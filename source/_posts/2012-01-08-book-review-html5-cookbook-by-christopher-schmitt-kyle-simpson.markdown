#### Summary






[HTML5 Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920016038.do) provides an overview and examples of new HTML 5 features and related JavaScript APIs. The cookbook series aims to provide short, targeted chapters that solve real world problems, and for simple use-cases, this book provides that.







Most of the material in the book could be found in online tutorials, but it provides a good overview of the available technologies in a single place. I wouldn't recommend this for developers who are already using/familiar with HTML 5, but it could be a great foundation for newbies who want to absorb a lot quickly. Personally, I felt that I had a solid foundation to start working with HTML 5 technologies after reading through the examples.






#### In a Nutshell:





  * Good compilation of intro material for HTML 5 and friends.


  * Filled with useful internet references.


  * Recipes are rather basic, but complete and well-written.


  * Great coverage of accessibility issues.


  * Probably less useful once the basics are understood.
