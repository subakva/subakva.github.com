![Finite Jest](http://subakva.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/finite-jest.jpg)
There's a trick to blogging.

I don't know what that trick is, but I intend to figure it out. I've had quite a few blogs in the past with sparse to middling success at maintaining them with new content. Maybe I ought to just throw in the towel and admit that I'm either too much of a perfectionist or too disorganized to maintain a blog successfully, but I can't shake the feeling that I really ought to be doing this, and doing it well.

So, this is my latest attempt at staking out some digital territory in the crowded, geek-o-sphere. It's [Subakva](http://subakva.com), which means, for those of us who don't speak [esperanto](http://lernu.net),  "underwater" (Prepare yourself for my upcoming blog entry on how to find an squatter-free domain name by learning obscure, artificial languages.)

If you're interested in web technology, interface design, and all that Geek 2.0 jazz, I predict that there will be something worthwhile for you to read here in the future. If you're not interested in any of that, then there's nothing for you here but heartache and disappointment. Go now, with your spirit still intact.

**Excelsior!**
