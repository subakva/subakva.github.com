[ShareableRouteSet - Gist](http://gist.github.com/556374)  


This is a class to allow the creation of Rails route helpers for external applications without interfering with the application routes.





This is useful when you have a Rails application that needs to have some knowledge about the routes in another application. The routes could be published by the source application in a plugin/gem to avoid duplication of routing information.
